# Riftbuddy
Riftbuddy is a small, proprietary software artefact that takes speech command inputs (single words) and respoonds accordingly. This artefact was created solely for my (James Wingate) Masters' Project/Thesis submission, and only exists as proof-of-concept for the Convolutional Neural Network model I have implemented for the speech recognition capabilities of this artefact. This software piece is not intended for public use, and is uploaded here simply for project management (versioning) purposes and proof of work completed.
